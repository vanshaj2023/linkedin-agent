# LinkedIn AI Agent

An automated agent powered by **Playwright** and **LangChain** to autonomously search for hiring posts, extract relevant profile details (authors, founders, senior engineers), and perform intelligent connections, reactions, and comments using an LLM.

## Project Structure

* `login.py`: An interactive script that opens a browser for manual login and saves the authenticated cookies to `state.json`.
* `browser_manager.py`: A utility that re-uses the `state.json` file to launch headless/headed browsers for automated tasks, bypassing login walls.
* `state.json` (auto-generated): Contains local cookies for LinkedIn authentication.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install playwright langchain langchain-openai langgraph pytest
   playwright install
   ```

2. **Login Setup:**
   Run the initial login script to generate your session state:
   ```bash
   python login.py
   ```
   *Follow the terminal instructions, log in through the visible browser, and press Enter in the terminal to save your state.*

*(Further instructions mapping to Phase 2 and 3 will be deposited here as we build them out).*

## Progress
### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- MongoDB integration implemented using `database.py` with full Pydantic schemas.
- Playwright Stealth wrapper mapped inside `browser_manager.py`.
- Core Global Action Queue (`action_queue.py`) built to centralize & rate limit requests.
- System Health, Circuit Breaker, and Budget Managers built inside `system_health.py` and `warmup.py`.
- Slack integration commands `/status` and `/pause` mocked in `slack_bot.py`.
- Dry run parameters structured securely into schemas.

### Phase 2: Connection Agent (Completed)
- LinkedIn people search scraper (`people_scraper.py`) to bypass layout limitations.
- Robust LLM integration (`llm_scorer.py`) utilizing LangChain and `gpt-4o` for relevance scoring and A/B template personalization notes.
- Agent Orchestration (`agent_connection.py`) parsing scrapes, verifying deductibles against `db.connections`, executing relevance checks, and pushing rate-limited connect actions into MongoDB queue.
- Acceptance Poller (`acceptance_poller.py`) scraping new connections and recording acceptances back into state.

*(Waiting for user commit before proceeding to Phase 3)*
